# hsctrl2gnome

Based on [headsetcontrol](https://github.com/Sapd/HeadsetControl) **hsctrl2gnome** creates a battery percentage panel for gnome via [KStatusNotifierItem/AppIndicator](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support/)

This is a simplified version of [headset-charge-indicator](https://github.com/centic9/headset-charge-indicator)
